## Task-05: Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

## Project Overview
Excited to announce the successful completion of Task-05 during my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech ðŸš€. This project involved analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualizing accident hotspots and contributing factors using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Description
Task-05 focused on the analysis of traffic accident data to uncover patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The project included data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of accident hotspots and contributing factors.

## Objectives
Import and clean data.

Visualize the distribution of a chosen variable using a bar chart or histogram.

Interpret the visualized data to derive meaningful insights.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for writing and running code.

Pandas: Data manipulation library.

Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static plots.

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
